        A self-introduction
        <p class="text-justify">
        Much of my research revolves around supermassive black holes; nevertheless, I have been always aiming to keep my interests broad. 
        Both supermassive black holes and the galaxies hosting them have a rich phenomenology,
        with huge data opening the era of multi-messenger astronomy (James Webb Space Telescope, Euclid, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Event-Horizon Telescope, Ice-Cube, Pulsar Timing Arrays, and more coming). From a theory perspective, 
        scientists are struggling to point down the key aspects of fundamental cosmic-scale processes such as star formation and AGN feedback (that means a lot of work to be done).
        Starting from the small scales, I have worked on radiation transfer in astrophysical jets, SED fitting (from radio to gamma-rays) of
        thermal and non-thermal radiation, population inference of massive black holes, and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that specialize in the inclusion of massive black hole physics. 
        During the last years of PhD, I'm focusing on Tidal Disruption Events. In particular, I have been trying to model the rate of tidal disruption events and find the effect on black hole growth. Also, in the last few months, I have performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations to
        understand the effects of a disk on the evolution of a tidal disruption event stream. I'm just referring to my few first-author publications below, 
         but please keep in mind there is much of my work to be published in the upcoming year!

        What is my occupation?
        <p class="text-justify">
        Physics in the universe can be tested by developing astrophysical models and performing simulations that can explain astronomy observations. Vice versa the data that telescopes collect
        sometimes seems bizarre and does not fit into our current understanding of stars, galaxies, black holes, etc. The information does not flow smoothly in either of these two directions; 
        For example, many times simulations are not being informed, and sometimes contradict, observations, while at the same time, observations are somewhat agnostic (e.g. are reported in non-physical units) and leave the interpretation
        for future investigations. With that said, I would refer to myself as a theoretical astrophysicist and an astronomer, really trying to have a holistic view of my subject. That means, I am willing to be involved in every
            aspect from data extraction to cosmological simulations that will deepen my understanding. Because of that, I find myself many times trying to build simple models to explain observations.
