        A self-introduction
        <p class="text-justify">
        Much of my research revolves around supermassive black holes, nevertheless, I have been always aiming to keep my interests broad. 
        Both supermassive black holes and the galaxies hosting them have a rich phenomenology,
        with new data being produced in (JWST, Euclid, LSST, EHT, PTAs, and more coming). From a theory perspective, 
        scientists are struggling to point down the key aspects of universal processes such as star formation and AGN feedback.
        I have worked on radiation transfer in astrophysical jets, SED fitting (from radio to gamma-rays) of
        thermal and non-thermal radiation, population inference of massive black holes, and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. 
        During the last years of PhD, I'm focusing on Tidal Disruption Events. In particular, in the last few months, I have performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations to
        understand the effects of a disk on the evolution of a tidal disruption event stream. I'm just referring to my few first-author publications below, 
         but please keep in mind there is much work to be done (at least from my side)!
        </p>
        What am I?
        Physics in the universe can be tested by developing astrophysical models and performing simulations that can explain astronomy observations. Vice versa the data that telescopes collect
        sometimes seems bizarre and does not fit into our current understanding of stars, galaxies, black holes, etc. The information does not flow smoothly in either of these two directions; 
        For example, many times simulations are not being informed, and sometimes contradict, observations, while at the same time, observations are somewhat agnostic (e.g. are reported in non-physical units) and leave interpretation
        for future investigations. With that said, I am referring to myself as a theoretical astrophysicist and an astronomer, really trying to have a holistic view of my subject.
