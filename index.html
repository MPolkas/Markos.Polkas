        A self-introduction
        <p class="text-justify">
        Physics in the universe can be tested by developing astrophysical models that can explain observations of astronomy. Vice versa the data telescopes collect
        sometimes seem bizarre and do not fit in our current understanding of stars, galaxies, and black holes. As a young astrophysicist, so far I have intended to use both information flow directions,
        refuting to dedicate solely on doing simulations (many times not being informed and sometimes contradicting observations) 
        or solely reporting new observations (usually in non-physical units, and leaving the understanding for future investigations). 
        Much of my research revolves around supermassive black holes, nevertheless, I always aim to keep my interests broad. I have worked on radiation transfer in astrophysical jets, SED fitting (from radio to gamma-rays) of
        thermal and non-thermal radiation, population inference of massive black holes, and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. During the last years of PhD, I'm focusing on Tidal Disruption Events. These months, I am performing a series of hydrodynamical simulations to
        understand the effects of a disk on the evolution of a tidal disruption event stream.  Both black holes and the galaxies hosting have a rich phenomenology, with new data just flowing in. From a theory perspective we are trailing behind in pointing down the key aspects of 
        universal processes such as star formation and AGN feedback. With that said, I refer to you with caution to some publications below, but keep in mind there is much work to be done (at least from my side)!!
