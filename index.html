        Physics in the universe can be tested by developing astrophysical models that can be tested against observations and vice versa observations can be
        explained by simple models that encode the underlying astrophysics in them. Both directions are fine with me, as long as you get out of it wiser.
        Much of my research revolves around supermassive black holes, but I always aim to keep my interests broad. I have worked on astrophysical jets (radiation transfer in blazars), SED fitting (from radio to gamma-rays) of
        thermal and non-thermal radiation, population inference of massive black holes. Both black holes and the galaxies hosting have a rich phenomenology, with new data just flowing in, yet from the theory perspective we are trailing behind in pointing down the key aspects of 
        universal processes such as star formation and AGN feedback. During the last years of PhD, I'm focusing on Tidal Disruption Events. These months, I am performing a series of hydrodynamical simulations to
        understand the effects of a disk on the evolution of a tidal disruption event stream.
