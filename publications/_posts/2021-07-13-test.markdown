In this project, we are interested in including Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation L-Galaxies. Having these events happening in a cosmological context, allows for exceptional statistics that are tested against the newest observations. As far as I am aware this is the first model that produced TDE rates that are in agreement with observations. The main result of paper I is the necessity for Nuclear Star Clusters around Massiv Black Holes to produce high rates. In follow-up work, having established that the statistics of TDEs, we will explore the effects on the growth of black holes and the feedback on their host galaxies. Tidal disruption events may serve as a crucial connection between the relation of black holes to their host galaxy and is so exciting to the generation of astrophysicists who are exploring this possibility in the light of new data (LSST).
