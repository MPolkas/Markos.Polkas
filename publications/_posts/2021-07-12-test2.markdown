In this project, we study blazar variability in an FSRQ and a BL Lac with a variable one zone leptonic model.
By solving the kinetic equations with a time-dependent input of parameters, that is motivated as to reproduce 10-year-long variability properties in gamma-rays, we study the
multiwavelength behavior of the blob. This study is first of its kind and a follow-up on using the model for exceptional good quality data of Mrk421 is coming soon from collaborators and me.
